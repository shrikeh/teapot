     * resource's state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server, when
     * meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to
     * a conflict.  By requiring requests to be conditional, the server can
     * assure that clients are working with the correct copies.
     *
     * Responses using this status code SHOULD explain how to resubmit the
     * request successfully.
     *
     * Responses with the 428 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.

    /**
     * The 429 status code indicates that the user has sent too many requests
     * in a given amount of time ("rate limiting").
     *
     * The response representations SHOULD include details explaining the
     * condition, and MAY include a Retry-After header indicating how long
     * to wait before making a new request.
     *
     * For example:
     *
     * HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
     * Content-Type: text/html
     * Retry-After: 3600
     * <html>

     *     logged in user.  Try again soon.</p>

     * identifies the user, nor how it counts requests.  For example, an
     * origin server that is limiting request rates can do so based upon
     * counts of requests on a per-resource basis, across the entire server,
     * or even among a set of servers.  Likewise, it might identify the user
     * by its authentication credentials, or a stateful cookie.

     * It can be used both when the set of request header fields in total is
     * too large, and when a single header field is at fault.  In the latter

     * expecting a response from the server that a request was made to, not
     * the intervening network infrastructure.  It is not intended to

     * caused by them.
     *
     * A network operator wishing to require some authentication, acceptance
     * of terms, or other user interaction before granting access usually
     * does so by identifying clients who have not done so ("unknown
     * clients") using their Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.
     *
     * Unknown clients then have all traffic blocked, except for that on TCP
     * port 80, which is sent to an HTTP server (the "login server")
     * dedicated to "logging in" unknown clients, and of course traffic to
     * the login server itself.
